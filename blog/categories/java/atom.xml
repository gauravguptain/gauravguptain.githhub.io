    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Because reflection involves types that are dynamically resolved, certain Java virtual machine optimizations can not be performed. Consequently, reflective operations have slower performance than their non-reflective counterparts, and should be avoided in sections of code which are called frequently in performance-sensitive applications.</p>

<h2 id="use-exceptions-only-for-exceptional-conditions">Use exceptions only for exceptional conditions</h2>
<p>Someday, if you are unlucky, you may stumble across a piece of code that looks something like this:</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="comment">// Horrible abuse of exceptions. Don't ever do this!</span>
<span class="keyword">try</span> {
   <span class="type">int</span> i = <span class="integer">0</span>;
   <span class="keyword">while</span>(<span class="predefined-constant">true</span>)
        range[i++].climb();
} <span class="keyword">catch</span>(<span class="exception">ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</span> e) {
}
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>What does this code do? It’s not at all obvious from inspection, and that’s reason enough not to use it. It turns out to be a horribly ill-conceived idiom for looping through the elements of an array. The infinite loop terminates by throwing, catching, and ignoring an <code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code> when it attempts to access the first array element outside the bounds of the array. It’s supposed to be equivalent to the standard idiom for looping through an array, which is instantly recognizable to any Java programmer:</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">for</span> (Mountain m : range)
    m.climb();
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So why would anyone use the exception-based loop in preference to the tried and true? It’s a misguided attempt to improve performance based on the faulty reasoning that, since the VM checks the bounds of all array accesses, the normal loop termination test—hidden by the compiler but still present in the for-each loop—is redundant and should be avoided. There are three things wrong with this reasoning:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Because exceptions are designed for exceptional circumstances, there is little incentive for JVM implementors to make them as fast as explicit tests.</li>
  <li>Placing code inside a try-catch block inhibits certain optimizations that modern JVM implementations might otherwise perform.</li>
  <li>The standard idiom for looping through an array doesn’t necessarily result in redundant checks. Modern JVM implementations optimize them away.</li>
</ul>

<p>In fact, the exception-based idiom is far slower than the standard one on modern JVM implementations. On my machine, the exception-based idiom is more than twice as slow as the standard one for arrays of one hundred elements.</p>

<p>Not only does the exception-based loop obfuscate the purpose of the code and reduce its performance, but it’s not guaranteed to work! In the presence of an unrelated bug, the loop can fail silently and mask the bug, greatly complicating the debugging process. Suppose the computation in the body of the loop invokes a method that performs an out-of-bounds access to some unrelated array. If a reasonable loop idiom were used, the bug would generate an uncaught exception, resulting in immediate thread termination with a full stack trace. If the misguided exception-based loop were used, the bug-related exception would be caught and misinterpreted as a normal loop termination.</p>

<p>The moral of this story is simple: <strong>exceptions are, as their name implies, to be used only for exceptional conditions; they should never be used for ordinary control flow</strong>. More generally, you should use standard, easily recognizable idioms in preference to overly clever techniques that purport to offer better performance. Even if the performance advantage is real, it may not remain in the face of steadily improving platform implementations. The subtle bugs and maintenance headaches that come from overly clever techniques, however, are sure to remain.</p>

<p>This principle also has implications for API design. <strong>A well-designed API must not force its clients to use exceptions for ordinary control flow</strong>. A class with a “state-dependent” method that can be invoked only under certain unpredictable conditions should generally have a separate “state-testing” method indicating whether it is appropriate to invoke the state-dependent method. For example, the Iterator interface has the state-dependent method next and the corresponding state-testing method hasNext. This enables the standard idiom for iterating over a collection with a traditional for loop (as well as the for-each loop, where the hasNext method is used internally):</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="predefined-type">Iterator</span> i = collection.iterator(); i.hasNext(); ) {
  Foo foo = i.next();
  ...
}
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If Iterator lacked the hasNext method, clients would be forced to do this instead:</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="comment">// Do not use this hideous code for iteration over a collection!</span>
<span class="keyword">try</span> {
  <span class="predefined-type">Iterator</span> i = collection.iterator();
  <span class="keyword">while</span>(<span class="predefined-constant">true</span>) {
       Foo foo = i.next();
       ...
  }
} <span class="keyword">catch</span> (<span class="exception">NoSuchElementException</span> e) {
}
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This should look very familiar after the array iteration example that began this item. In addition to being wordy and misleading, the exception-based loop is likely to perform poorly and can mask bugs in unrelated parts of the system.</p>

<p>An alternative to providing a separate state-testing method is to have the statedependent method return a distinguished value such as null if it is invoked with the object in an inappropriate state. This technique would not be appropriate for Iterator, as null is a legitimate return value for the next method.</p>

<p>Here are some guidelines to help you choose between a state-testing method and a distinguished return value. If an object is to be accessed concurrently without external synchronization or is subject to externally induced state transitions, you must use a distinguished return value, as the object’s state could change in the interval between the invocation of a state-testing method and its state-dependent method. Performance concerns may dictate that a distinguished return value be used if a separate state-testing method would duplicate the work of the statedependent method. All other things being equal, a state-testing method is mildly preferable to a distinguished return value. It offers slightly better readability, and incorrect use may be easier to detect: if you forget to call a state-testing method, the state dependent method will throw an exception, making the bug obvious; if you forget to check for a distinguished return value, the bug may be subtle.</p>

<p>In summary, exceptions are designed for use in exceptional conditions. Don’t use them for ordinary control flow, and don’t write APIs that force others to do so.</p>
